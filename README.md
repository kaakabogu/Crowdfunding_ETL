# Crowdfunding_ETL
Mini project 2
The ETL mini project was a team work and our focus on this project was to put our data analytics skills into practice. During the project, we used methods from Python, Pandas and soem of the Python disctionaries to extract and transform the data. The data were transformed and extracted as four CSV files which were used to create an ERD and a table schema. Using PG Admin, then we uploaded the CSV files into a Postgres database. 

The ETL mini project was conducted through a collaborative effort among team members, with a central objective of applying data analytics skills in a practical context. The team leveraged various tools and techniques, including Python, Pandas, and Python dictionaries, to facilitate the extraction and transformation of the data. Specifically, the data was transformed and extracted into four distinct CSV files, which were subsequently employed in generating an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) and a corresponding table schema.

To facilitate the storage and management of the transformed data, the team utilized PG Admin, a widely used tool for managing PostgreSQL databases. The CSV files were uploaded into a Postgres database through PG Admin, thereby enabling efficient querying and analysis of the data. The process was carried out meticulously, following detailed instructions (copied below), and the outputs were captured in screenshots for further analysis and evaluation.

Overall, the ETL mini project represented a practical opportunity for the team to put their data analytics skills into practice, while leveraging a diverse array of tools and techniques. The successful completion of the project, including the extraction, transformation, and uploading of data, is a testament to the efficacy of the team's approach and the tools employed in the project.
